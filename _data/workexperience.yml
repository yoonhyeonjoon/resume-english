- company: LG Display / Operating System Design Team
  position: Senior researcher, image processing algorithm development
  duration: 2017.09.28 ~ 2020.10.25
  summary: <p>

    <span class="sub-description">Team Roles</span> <b> <span class="period-mark">:</span> </b> <br>
    After developing and testing an image processing algorithm to be applied to OLED(Organic Light Emitting Diodes) using C++/Matlab/Python, etc., it is implemented at the hardware level through Verilog and mass-produced as ASICs. <br>
    Integrating the modules for operating the device to have one operating system. And by designing an automated process for verification of mass-produced chips, the time and cost required for chip verification are reduced. <br>

    <span class="period-mark">●</span>	Circuit Compensation Algorithm development and verification (Python, Verilog) <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp-	Development of circuit status recognition and improvement algorithm for OLED Circuit level <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp-	Development and application of OLED burn-in prevention algorithm <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp-	Development of image data compression algorithm <br>
    <br>
    <span class="period-mark">●</span>	SoC Algorithm Verification automation system development (Python) <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp-	Developed the first system to change the operation verification work for Chip Algorithm from man-power to automation <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp-	Script-based Command-aware Lexer and Parser implemented in Python <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp-	By implementing each module based on Factory method design pattern, it is easy to design object management when executing each command. <br>
