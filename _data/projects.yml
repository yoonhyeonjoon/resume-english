      We have developed an android application for area-based meeting arrangement service. <br>
      Planning, development, manage, design, and advertising were all made with younger brother. <br>
      The app development part used Kotlin, the back-end was Firebase, and the server side (cron, push message, etc) was implemented with node.js. <p>
    </ul>

    <ul style="-webkit-padding-start:15px;">
    <span class="sub-description">Developed features:</span> <b> <span class="period-mark">:</span> </b> <br>
    &nbsp <span class="period-mark">●</span> Login (Kakao / Google / Phone / Email), member profile management section <br>
    &nbsp <span class="period-mark">●</span> Registration and inquiry of meeting recruitment posts based on naver map <br>
    &nbsp <span class="period-mark">●</span> Introduce local members and arrange meetings <br>
    &nbsp <span class="period-mark">●</span> Chat service (Firebase + Room cache) and Push Notification <br>
    &nbsp <span class="period-mark">●</span> Payment (Google Billing API) <br>
    &nbsp <span class="period-mark">●</span> Notice, report, user manual <br>
    &nbsp <span class="period-mark">●</span> Dedicated master-app for member management <br>

    </ul>

    <ul style="-webkit-padding-start:15px;">
    <span class="sub-description">Progress since development</span> <b> <span class="period-mark">:</span> </b> <br>
    &nbsp <span class="period-mark">●</span> Current cumulative 200 subscribers <br>
    &nbsp <span class="period-mark">●</span> Advertising expenses (using Google Ads (Seoul and Gyeonggi-do targets), more than 200,000 won) <br>
    &nbsp <span class="period-mark">●</span> Main subscriber male over 50 years old <br>

    <br>

    For the above reasons, we are renewing because it is necessary to improve the design and internal code and redefine the target audience. <br>
    I am currently migrating all my code using NavGraph / Compose.
